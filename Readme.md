"It was a quiet evening when little Aryan returned home from playing outside. Excited, he ran up to the door and knocked eagerly. But to his surprise, it didn’t open.\n\n"
    "From inside, his mother’s voice called out, 'You know the rule, Aryan. I can’t open the door unless you knock the right way.'\n\n"
    "Aryan sighed, recalling her lesson. It wasn’t just any knock—it had to be in a precise order. A single mistake meant starting over. He took a deep breath, tapped twice, paused, knocked three times, then finished with one last tap.\n\n"
    "Silence filled the air.\n\n"
    "Then, the door creaked open. His mother smiled. 'Good boy,' she said. 'Always remember, the right sequence is the key to unlocking what’s hidden.'\n\n"
    "But what if someone else had knocked? What if they didn’t know the secret pattern? The door would have remained shut, the mystery unsolved.\n\n"
    "Some doors aren’t opened by keys—only by knowing the right rhythm. And in this challenge, you must uncover that rhythm yourself."
